##Cipher behavior

The cipher class is responsible for decoding text using a key file.
The key file is expected to have two lines:
the first line contains the original characters
the second line contains the cipher characters
Each character in the second line maps to the character in the same position in the first line.

Example:
line 1: abcdef
line 2: bcdefa

##CipherService Class

The constructor takes a file path to a key file, and tbe he key file is read and a mapping is created from cipher characters to original characters.

method: decipher(String text)
each character in the input is replaced using the mapping

if a character is not found in the mapping, it is left unchanged

key file:
abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890
bcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ1234567890a
